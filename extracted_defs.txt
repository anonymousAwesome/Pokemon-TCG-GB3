Planned gameplay loop:

start at main. Load the most recent player location (screen and coordinates) from player.py. 
Perpetually check:
 if the player moved onto an event tile, which may trigger a cutscene or move the player to a different screen.  
 if the player pressed the interact button while facing an interactable object.
Either way, the appropriate event from event_database is triggered. This may involve calling the dialogue function and some sort of player choice function.
If the event




The single biggest issue right now is getting the UI working. Specifically, the main duel menu. 

I want a general-purpose function that takes dimensions and places the white background rectangle and the blue outline bars around it.

For the duel menu specifically, I want a function that places the standard options and the cursor on the screen. I'll worry about expanding it to include other menus later.
