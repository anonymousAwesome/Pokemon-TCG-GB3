A full list of all references and sources of inspiration in this game, in roughly chronological order:

Mason's Lab: A lot of what happens here is a direct reference to the previous game, "Pok√©mon TCG GB2: Team Great Rocket Arrives!", as are the "ping-pong tables".
Mason's Lab: The game on the computer is based on one of the earliest computer games, Pong, as well as the knockoff version "Paddle War" found in Commander Keen 4, 5, and 6.
Rock Club: Hal's name and dialogue are a reference to the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey
Psychic Club: Uri Geller's lawsuit against Pokemon
Psychic Club: Toolo from Team Four Star's Dragon Ball Z Abridged
Psychic Club (spooky version): The profile image of the NPCs, as well as Sluggy's dialogue, is based on the author avatar from the webcomic Sluggy Freelance used in [one of the filler weeks](https://archives.sluggy.com/book.php?chapter=28#2002-03-13). The other NPC names are just to mask the reference, though some of them do share names with [Hereti-Corp codenames](https://archives.sluggy.com/book.php?chapter=65#2013-11-13), which was itself a direct reference to the movie Reservoir Dogs.
Science Club: The streamer ProJared
Fighting Club: Fight Club
Pokemon-ex exterior: The Order of the Stick. ("Stupid railroad plots.")
Pokemon-ex interior: The Legend of Zelda series ("You are now five rupees poorer.")

Dark Club: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/card-games-on-motorcycles

(Note that the Dark Club NPCs are not references to the Pokemon anime, unlike most of the other Neo Continent clubs.)
Ghost Club: NPCs are from Danny Phantom
Ghost Club: The map layout is based on the Colorless Altar location from GB2
Ice Club: the map layout is literally just the Mahogany Gym from Pokemon GSC.
Normal Club: The club layout, characters, and dialogue are all taken from different places in Pokemon Red/Blue.
Trading Post: Charity uses a sprite only found in one place in Pokemon GSC. In Fuchsia City, the Pokemon Center lady inexplicably has green hair.
Trading Post: Charity's portrait is based loosely on some very old Ken Sugimori Pokemon Nurse artwork: https://imgur.com/a/FZagZBs
Trading Post: Jumbo Steve's portrait is the Hiker class from Ruby/Sapphire
Trading Post: The map layout was loosely based on a Gen1 Pokemon Center.

Neo Continent Grandmaster Stadium: Crono, Lucca, Marle, and Magus are all characters from Chrono Trigger
Neo Continent Grandmaster Stadium: Lucca's deck contains Entei and Unown, a weak reference to the third Pokemon movie
Final duel: Yu-gi-oh (Heavy Storm card)
Final duel: [AI-generated Magic: The Gathering cards](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/custom-card-creation/612057-generating-magic-cards-using-deep-recurrent-neural) (Slidshocking Krow with Tromple and Mointainspalk). Note that those cards were generated several years before AI became frighteningly competent; at the time, it was just somebody's toy project, presumably built for fun.
Ronald's dialogue: Futurama

The design of the Forbidden Faction cultist robes are not an intentional reference to the Konosuba game "Love for these Clothes of Desire"; I'm just too lazy to come up with my own design.
Which, arguably, fits the theme of Konosuba.
