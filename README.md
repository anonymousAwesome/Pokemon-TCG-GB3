#Pokemon TCG GB3: Rise of the Forbidden Faction

This program is a fangame sequel to the Pokemon TCG games for the Game Boy Color. The player explores the game world, defeats duellists at the Pokemon Trading Card Game, and collects cards to improve their deck.

The program uses the Pygame module for gameplay and pygbag to export the game to HTML5 for browser play.

##Planned features:

* Every card from Base to Neo expansions, plus Japanese-only cards that never got an official English release. That's roughly a thousand cards.

* Over 64 duellists, each with their own unique deck.

* Two maps: TCG Island and Neo Continent, each containing their own card clubs and rewarding the player with different cards.

* A villainous organization, the Forbidden Faction, who use powerful forbidden cards.

* Extra duel challenges to spice up the gameplay.
