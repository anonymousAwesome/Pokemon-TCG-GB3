#Pokemon TCG GB3: Rise of the Forbidden Faction

This program is a fangame sequel to the Pokemon TCG games for the Game Boy Color. The player explores the game world, defeats duellists in a card game, and collects cards to improve their deck.

The program uses the Pygame module for gameplay and pygbag to export the game to HTML5 for browser play.

##Planned features:

* Every card from Base to Neo expansions, plus Japanese-only cards that never got an official English release. That's roughly a thousand cards.

* Over 64 trainers, each with their own unique deck.

* Two maps: TCG Island and Neo Continent, each containing their own card clubs and rewarding the player with different cards.

* A villainous organization, the Forbidden Faction, who use powerful forbidden cards.

* Extra duel challenges to spice up the gameplay.
